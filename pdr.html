            <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
            <p>Access to clean drinking water is essential for public health, yet water contamination with heavy metal ions remains a critical issue worldwide. Heavy metals such as lead, cadmium, and zinc can accumulate in water supplies due to industrial discharge, mining activities, and corrosion of infrastructure. Chronic exposure to these contaminants poses severe health risks, including neurological disorders, organ damage, and developmental impairments. As a result, effective and affordable water purification technologies are necessary to ensure safe drinking water, particularly in regions with limited access to high-quality filtration systems.</p>
            <p>This preliminary design report outlines the approach for an adaptive water purification system focused on the removal of heavy metal ions using activated carbon as the primary filtration medium. The device aims to efficiently remove contaminants from tap water, ensuring access to clean drinking water. It incorporates dynamic adaptability, allowing the purification process to adjust based on varying contaminant concentrations. The primary method for monitoring purification status will be conductivity measurements using a Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) sensor, which provides real-time feedback on water quality.</p>
            <p>The range of contaminants in tap water varies based on local water sources and treatment processes. While municipal water treatment facilities often regulate contaminant levels, trace amounts of heavy metals, organic compounds, and residual disinfectants can still be present. By focusing on heavy metal removal, this project addresses one of the most persistent and hazardous water quality concerns. Zinc sulfate (ZnSO₄) is selected as a model contaminant for testing due to its availability, moderate toxicity, and relevance to industrial pollution.This targeted approach will streamline the design and testing phases while addressing critical aspects of water safety.</p>

            <h2>2. Filter and Model Contaminant</h2>
            <h3>2.1 Filter: Activated Carbon</h3>
            <p>Activated carbon is selected as the filtration material due to its exceptional adsorption properties:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Large Surface Area:</strong> The porous nature of activated carbon allows heavy metal ions to be deposited within its pores, enhancing its adsorption capability.</li>
                <li><strong>Abundant Surface Functional Groups:</strong> Functional groups on the surface of activated carbon can form complexes with metal ions, further facilitating adsorption and improving removal efficiency.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Given these characteristics, activated carbon serves as an effective adsorbent for removing Zn and other heavy metal contaminants from water sources.</p>
            <h4>2.1.2 Caveats & Mitigation Strategies</h4>
            <p>Some functional groups present on activated carbon may deprotonate, altering the conductivity of the solution. Since conductivity measurements will be utilized to monitor heavy metal concentrations, maintaining solution stability is crucial. The solution pH must be maintained below the Point of Zero Charge (PZC) of activated carbon, which is approximately pH 7 for commercially available activated carbon. Keeping the pH below this threshold minimizes deprotonation, thereby preserving the reliability of conductivity-based sensing.</p>
            <p>Another concern is that activated carbon may contain residual minerals from processing, which could leach into the water and interfere with conductivity measurements. To mitigate this issue, thorough rinsing of activated carbon before use is recommended to eliminate residual minerals and ensure more accurate conductivity readings. Proper pre-treatment of the activated carbon ensures that the system’s readings remain reliable and that external factors do not contribute to variations in conductivity measurements.</p>
            <h3>2.2 Model Contaminant</h3>
            <p>Zinc (Zn) is selected as the model heavy metal contaminant. Specifically, zinc sulfate (ZnSO₄) is chosen due to the following reasons:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Relatively Lower Toxicity:</strong> Compared to other heavy metals such as lead or cadmium, Zn is less toxic, making it a safer model contaminant for initial testing.</li>
                <li><strong>Commercial Availability:</strong> Zinc sulfate (ZnSO₄) is widely available and serves as a practical contaminant source for experimental validation.</li>
                <li><strong>pH Considerations:</strong> At a concentration of 30 ppm, ZnSO₄ maintains a relatively low pH (~6.4), ensuring better compatibility with the activated carbon filtration mechanism.</li>
            </ul>

        <section id="sensor">
            <h2>3. Sensor: TDS Meter</h2>
            <p>The Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) meter is a critical component in our water purification system, ensuring the removal of dissolved heavy metal ions, particularly zinc and sulfate, from the water. The meter operates by measuring the electrical conductivity of the water, which directly correlates to the concentration of dissolved solids.</p>
            <h3>3.1 Relevance to Water Purification Process</h3>
            <p>Our system is designed to purify water that has been intentionally contaminated with zinc sulfate. The purification process involves passing the water through an activated carbon filter, which effectively removes heavy metal ions and other contaminants. The TDS meter plays a crucial role in monitoring this purification process by continuously measuring the water’s conductivity until it reaches an acceptable threshold.</p>
            <h3>3.2 Operational Principles</h3>
            <p>The sensor operates based on the following principles:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Input and Output Parameters:</strong> The TDS sensor operates within an input voltage range of 3.3V–5.5V and provides an analog output voltage between 0V and 2.3V, which is read by an Arduino microcontroller.</li>
                <li><strong>Measurement Mechanism:</strong> The sensor detects changes in electrical conductivity caused by dissolved ions. Higher ion concentrations result in increased conductivity, while a successful purification process should lower conductivity values.</li>
                <li><strong>Accuracy and Calibration:</strong> The sensor has a measurement accuracy of ±10% Full Scale at 25°C, necessitating calibration to ensure reliable readings.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>3.3 Integration into the System</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Initial Measurement: Before purification, the TDS meter records the baseline conductivity of zinc sulfate-contaminated water.</li>
                <li>Filtration Process: The water is passed through the activated carbon filter, which absorbs and removes metal ions.</li>
                <li>Post-Filtration Monitoring: The TDS meter continuously measures conductivity to determine whether ion levels have been sufficiently reduced.</li>
                <li>Threshold-Based Control: Once the TDS reading falls below the pre-set threshold, the system confirms successful purification.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>4.2 Components</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Top Chamber:</strong> Serves as the initial reservoir where water is introduced into the system.</li>
                <li><strong>Filtration Unit:</strong> Houses activated charcoal and facilitates water purification.</li>
                <li><strong>Bottom Chamber:</strong> Collects filtered water and integrates the TDS sensor for real-time monitoring.</li>
                <li><strong>Peristaltic Pump:</strong> Ensures controlled and consistent water circulation.</li>
                <li><strong>Arduino Control System:</strong> Monitors TDS levels and automates the purification process.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>4.3 Circuit Design & Control Mechanisms</h3>
